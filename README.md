Tomorrow's Stocks

  This project was our attempt at importing important information concerning the S&P 500 and using that information to assist anyone looking to learn mora about the 
current and possibly future status of stock prices.

*The home page is meant to be a comfortable place for our end users as they look at both stock specific charts and also charts that present information concerning the entire s&p 500.

*Our drop down menue allows for a closer look at all chart we use in the home page.

* The Tree Map shows the entire S&P 500. Green means an increase in price over the last 6 months and red shows a decrease. The larger the change the larger the squares. 

*The Word Map allows a quick view into the news connected with the stock you wish to choose. Once the Word Map is up click an interesting word and you will find articles popping up below the Word Map. 

*Data is a simple page holding all of the data involved in our project. Ferel free to scrape the information.
